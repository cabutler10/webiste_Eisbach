      </Typography>

      <Typography className={classes.text}>
        6.1 If you subscribe to our e-mail newsletter, we will send you regular
        information about our offers. The only mandatory information for sending
        the newsletter is your e-mail address. The indication of additional
        possible data is voluntary and is used to be able to address you
        personally. We use the so-called double opt-in procedure for sending the
        newsletter. This means that we will not send you an e-mail newsletter,
        unless you have expressly confirmed to us that you agree to the sending
        of the newsletter. We will then send you a confirmation e-mail asking
        you to confirm that you wish to receive future newsletters by clicking
        on an appropriate link. By activating the confirmation link, you give us
        your consent to the use of your personal data in accordance with Art. 6
        (1) point a GDPR. When you register for the newsletter, we store your IP
        address entered by the Internet Service Provider (ISP) as well as the
        date and time of registration so that we can trace any possible misuse
        of your e-mail address at a later time. The data collected by us when
        you register for the newsletter will be used exclusively for the purpose
        of advertising by means of the newsletter. You can unsubscribe from the
        newsletter at any time via the link provided in the newsletter or by
        sending a message to the responsible person named above. After your
        cancellation, your e-mail address will immediately be deleted from our
        newsletter distribution list, unless you have expressly consented to
        further use of your data or we reserve the right to use data in excess
        thereof, which is permitted by law and about which we inform you in this
        declaration.

      <Typography className={classes.text}>
        6.2 Our e-mail newsletters are sent via the technical service provider,
        The Rocket Science Group, LLC d/b/a MailChimp, 675 Ponce de Leon Ave NE,
        Suite 5000, Atlanta, GA 30308, USA (https://mailchimp.com), to whom we
        pass on the data you provided when registering for the newsletter. This
        disclosure is made in accordance with Art. 6 (1) point f GDPR and serves
        our legitimate interest in the use of an effective, secure and
        user-friendly newsletter system. Please note that your data is usually
        transferred to a MailChimp server in the USA and stored there. MailChimp
        uses this information to send and statistically evaluate the newsletter
        on our behalf. For evaluation purposes, the e-mails sent contain
        so-called web beacons or tracking pixels, which represent single-pixel
        image files stored on our website. This allows us to determine whether a
        newsletter message has been opened and which links have been clicked on.
        In addition, technical information is recorded (e.g. time of retrieval,
        IP address, browser type and operating system). The data are collected
        exclusively in a pseudonymized format and are not linked with other
        personal data from you. A direct personal relationship is excluded. This
        data is used exclusively for statistical analysis of newsletter
        campaigns. The results of these analyses can be used to better adapt
        future newsletters to the interests of the recipients. If you wish to
        object to the data analysis for statistical evaluation purposes, you
        must unsubscribe from the newsletter. Furthermore, MailChimp can use
        this data according to Art. 6 (1) point f GDPR even on the basis of its
        own legitimate interest in the demand-oriented design and optimization
        of the service as well as for market research purposes, for example to
        determine from which countries recipients come. However, MailChimp does
        not use the data of our newsletter recipients to address those
        recipients or pass that data on to third parties. To protect your data
        in the USA, we have concluded a data processing agreement
        ("Data-Processing-Agreement") with MailChimp on the basis of the
        standard contractual clauses of the European Commission to enable the
        transmission of your personal data to MailChimp. If you are interested
        in viewing this data processing agreement, you can do so at the
        following Internet link:
        https://mailchimp.com/legal/forms/data-processing-agreement/ MailChimp
        is also certified under the US-European data protection agreement
        "Privacy Shield" and thus undertakes to comply with EU data protection
        regulations. The data protection regulations of MailChimp can be viewed

        "payment by installments" via PayPal. For this purpose, your payment
        data may be passed on to credit agencies on the basis of PayPal's
        legitimate interest in determining your solvency pursuant to Art. 6 (1)
        point f GDPR. PayPal uses the result of the credit assessment in
        relation to the statistical probability of non-payment for the purpose
        of deciding on the provision of the respective payment method. The
        credit report can contain probability values (so-called score values).
        If score values are included in the result of the credit report, they
        are based on recognized scientific, mathematical-statistical methods.
        The calculation of the score values includes, but is not limited to,

        the credit agencies used, please refer to PayPal's data protection
        declaration at: https://www.paypal.com/uk/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full.

        personal data if this is necessary for contractual payment processing.
